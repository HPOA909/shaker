This is a caching proxy, based on apt-cacher-ng.
Note that it expects a netvm called "tor" - you should change this to whatever netvm you want to use.
Edit the netvm entry in create.sls

Config files are included, which will work out of the box for Debian,Ubuntu and Fedora.
The cache and log directories are bind-mounted in /rw in the cacher qube.

apt-cacher-ng will cache HTTPS requests if you change https:// to http://HTTPS/// in repo source lists.
Look at change_templates.sls for a suggestion how to do this across all templates.

Copy directory to /srv/salt
qubesctl state.apply cacher.create
qubesctl --skip-dom0 --targets=template-cacher state.apply cacher.install
qubesctl --skip-dom0 --targets=cacher state.apply cacher.configure
